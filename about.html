  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello Everybody, I am a Student at Binghamton University studying Computer Science and Math.
<br/>
The main reason I got so into computers when I was young, was because of my uncle Tony. He lived pretty close to us and used to run a computer repair shop. Whenever I would visit, I would see him working on computers, removing viruses, and diagnosing problems. When I got old enough, -- lets say 10 or so --  he decided it was time to teach me how to build my own computer.
<br/>
We gathered all the parts and one day, we just put it all together and fired it up. It worked the first time! From then on, I had an interest in how computers functioned and have built three more since.
<br/>
<h2> What specific CS field to you intend to pursue? Why? </h2>
<br/>
Not sure right now, but I am currently leaning towards human computer interaction. I like this topic because I expect human lives to become more intertwined with technology as it becomes more mobile and would like to be part of that change.
<br/>
<h3>
    By human interaction do you mean more and better AIs? Or more like Wall-E?
</h3>
<br/>
In a more general sense, I mean anything that a human will interact with in their life, which is a very broad group. I feel like I might enjoy programming on things like cameras, cars, planes....devices.

In regards to AI, I think that working on ‘evolutionary’ programming, where you program things that then program themselves or others. There is one guy in England that is working on a pretty neat project, angelina, he calls it. It's an AI that will take certain themes, rules and basic instructions and will program itself a game. <a href:"http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/">[http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/]</a>
<br/>
That is something I think is really neat.
